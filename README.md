# Crowdfunding_ETL

Hello, this was a collaboration between Paul Boerstoel, Vigneshwar Cheriath, and Oliver Kisza. We did a lot of the work collaboratively during class time. 

For the contacts dataframe we did option 1, so without using regex. 

The files we uploaded are as follows: ETL_Mini_Project_PBoerstoel_OKisza_VCheriath.ipynb This is the notebook we did the first part, importing the csv's and cleaning the data before exporting again to csv.

crowdfunding_db_schema.sql: The schema used to create the database in sql

erd_project2.png: an image of the erd of our database

And the resources folder contains all our final csv's
